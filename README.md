# Image Cartoonifier

## Introduction 
Image cartoonifier is an image processing project which involves the technique of converting the RGB color image into an accurate, cartooned image without multiple filtrations or blurred image without proper facilitation of edge detection. This user interface allows user to apply animation effects and naturally provides an artistic effect to real life pictures.

## Objective
The project “Image Cartoonifier” is implemented using Python and OpenCV. Python is the pool of libraries. It has numerous libraries for real-world applications. One such library is OpenCV. OpenCV is a cross-platform library used for real-time Computer Vision and Machine Learning. It includes applications like video and image capturing and processing. It majorly supports all languages like Python, C++, Android, Java, etc. and is widely used in image transformation, object detection and face recognition.

## Python modules used
1. CV2: Imported to use OpenCV for image processing
2. easygui: Imported to open a file box. It allows users to select any file from the system.
